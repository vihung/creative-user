    <h1>The Game of Literature</h1>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>Players and Teams</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>the game is played with six players.</li>
          <li>players are split into two teams of three each</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>the Deck</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>all twos are discarded from the standard deck of cards leaving 48 cards, 3 to A of all suits</li>
          <li>deck is conceptually split into eight sets - a lower set 3-8 (inclusive) and higher set 9-A (inclusive) of each suit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Game</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>deck is shuffled</li>
          <li>players are dealt the cards - eight cards each</li>
          <li>aim is for a team to accumulate as many sets as possible. higher set has 5 points, lower has 3</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Turn Play</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>the player whoâ€™s turn it is asks a player from the opposite team for a named card, e.g. 8 of hearts</li>
          <li>if the asked player has it, it must be given and turn stays with the asking player</li>
          <li>asking player can only ask for a card in a set for which he has at least one card in hand, e.g 8 of hearts only if he has at least one card
            in the higher hearts set</li>
          <li>if the asked player does not have the card, turn passes to him</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Claiming a Set</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>if the player whose turn it is is convinced that their team holds an entire set between them, they can claim it</li>
          <li>the claiming player must show their own cards for that set</li>
          <li>the claiming player must declare which team member holds which card</li>
          <li>if they are correct, the team gets the points for that set</li>
          <li>if they are wrong, the opposing team claims the set and gets the points</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>End Game</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>the game ends when all sets have been claimed</li>
          <li>The winning team is the one with the most points</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bluffing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>it is allowed to ask for a card already in your hand</li>
          <li>it is not allowed to ask for a card if you do not hold any cards in the same set</li>
          <li>it you hold the card that is asked of you, you must provide it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Signalling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>players in a team should play co-operatively with one another, against the opposing team</li>
          <li>players are not allowed to talk or confer or in any direct way communicate the cards in their hand</li>
          <li>when one player asks for a card, they are signalling that they are trying to accumulate that set</li>
          <li>other team members should attempt to continue the call for cards in that set (if they can do so per the rules above)</li>
          <li>if a player starts a call for a particular card and a team mate has that card they can signal this to their team mates by starting another
            call for a card in the same set when it is their turn</li>
        </ul>
